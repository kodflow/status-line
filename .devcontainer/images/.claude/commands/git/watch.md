# Watch Workflow (--watch)

**Active CI, review & code quality loop -- resolves ALL issues so `--merge` is a clean final action.**

**Flow:** `/git --commit` --> `/git --watch` --> `/git --merge`

```yaml
action_watch:
  trigger: "--watch"
  refresh_interval: 60s
  stop: "Ctrl+C ONLY (user interrupt)"

  # ─── ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER STOP ─────────────────────────────
  # --watch runs in an infinite loop until ALL conditions are green.
  # Do NOT present "options" to the user. Do NOT suggest they retry.
  # Do NOT stop because of stalls. Keep polling with sleep(60).
  # The ONLY exit is: all green OR Ctrl+C.

  # ─── Phase 4.5: Review Triage with Legitimacy Filter ────────
  #
  # THIS IS THE CORE OF --watch: fetch all review findings,
  # judge each one for legitimacy, fix legitimate issues,

  # to each bot explaining the decision.
  #
  # --watch does ALL the review work so --merge has nothing to do.

    # ── Step 3: Legitimacy Filter (CRITICAL) ────────────────
    #
    # Before fixing ANY finding, judge whether it is LEGITIMATE
    # or ILLEGITIMATE. This prevents regressions from blindly
    # applying bot suggestions.
    #
    # ILLEGITIMATE findings (REJECT with justification):
    #   - Downgrade language/tool version (e.g., "use Go 1.21" when project uses 1.26)
    #   - Remove a feature or capability the project intentionally provides
    #   - Change architecture in a way that contradicts CLAUDE.md or project conventions
    #   - Suggest patterns incompatible with the project's stack
    #   - Style preferences that contradict existing codebase conventions
    #   - False positives (rule doesn't apply to this context)
    #
    # LEGITIMATE findings (FIX):
    #   - Real bugs (null pointer, off-by-one, race condition)
    #   - Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)
    #   - Unused imports/variables
    #   - Missing error handling
    #   - Performance issues with clear fix
    #   - Documentation/typo fixes
    #   - Actual code quality improvements that align with project conventions
    #
    legitimacy_filter:
      for_each_finding:
        1_read_context: "Read the affected file + surrounding code"
        2_check_project_rules: "Consult CLAUDE.md, language RULES.md, and conventions"
        3_judge: |
          Classify as:
            LEGITIMATE   → real issue, should be fixed
            ILLEGITIMATE → contradicts project, would cause regression
            UNCLEAR      → needs more context → ask user via AskUserQuestion before acting
        4_record_decision: "Store verdict + justification for each finding"

    # ── Step 4: Fix Legitimate Findings ─────────────────────
    fix_loop:
      flow: |
        WHILE relevant_count > 0 AND iteration < max_iterations:
          1. Separate findings into LEGITIMATE vs ILLEGITIMATE
          2. Fix all LEGITIMATE findings (code changes)
          3. Commit: "fix(review): address {source} findings"
          4. Push to branch
          5. Respond to bots (see interaction below)
          6. Wait for re-reviews (max 120s)
          7. Re-fetch and re-classify
          8. Check: relevant_count == 0?

               This creates a new COMMENT review that supersedes the CHANGES_REQUESTED state.
            3. Post "@coderabbitai resolve" in same comment
            4. CONTINUE POLLING — do NOT stop

        # CRITICAL: @coderabbitai resolve in issue comments does NOT resolve
        # individual review threads. It only works as a bot command.
