```

## Question 2: Max Iterations

```yaml

## Phase 4.0: Peek (RLM Pattern)

**Quick scan BEFORE any modification:**

```yaml
peek_workflow:
  0_git_check:
    action: "Check git status (conflict detection)"
    tools: [Bash]
    command: "git status --porcelain"
    checks:
      - "No merge/rebase in progress"
      - "Target files not already modified (warning if so)"
    on_conflict:
      action: "Warning + continue (not blocking)"
      message: "⚠ Uncommitted changes detected on target files"

  1_structure:
    action: "Scan the scope structure"
    tools: [Glob]
    patterns:
      - "src/**/*.{ts,js,go,py,rs}"
      - "tests/**/*"
      - "package.json | go.mod | Cargo.toml | pyproject.toml"

  2_patterns:
    action: "Identify existing patterns"
    tools: [Grep]
    searches:
      - "class.*Factory" → Factory pattern
      - "getInstance" → Singleton
      - "describe|test|it" → Existing tests

  3_stack_detect:
    action: "Detect the tech stack"
    checks:
      - "package.json → Node.js/npm"
      - "go.mod → Go"
      - "Cargo.toml → Rust"
      - "pyproject.toml → Python"
    output: "test_command, lint_command, build_command"
```

**Output Phase 4.0:**
